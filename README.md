# qr-tag-gen-scan
##### This is a qr code generator and scanner web page.

- I have used vite-react to develop this web. and to generate qr tagi used react-qr-code lib and to scan the qr tag i used qrscanner.
- In this react-qr-code, i have used an api of react-qr-code to download the qr tag image.
* > if u dont want to use api for downloading imgae then u can use ```qr-code``` lib. here, u can directly get an url for qr tag and easily download with <a/> tag
